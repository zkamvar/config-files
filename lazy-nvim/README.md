# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

> [NOTE]
>
> Sometimes I get myself into a borked state (especially with mason). The way to
> get unborked is to [let lazyvim reinstall everything from scratch](https://github.com/mason-org/mason.nvim/issues/1934#issuecomment-2873020222):
>
> ```sh
> rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
> rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim
> rm -rf ~/.cache/nvim
> ```
